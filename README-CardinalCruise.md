# Integrating 3D-Secure (Payer Authentication) with Cardinal Cruise . 

Authorize.Net supports authentication of the consumer/cardholder through the industry standard protocol of 3D-Secure (also known as Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode).
Cardinal Commerce provides a simple javascript library (Cardinal Cruise) to facilitate this consumer authentication and our sample application demonstrates the integration of Cardinal Cruise with Authorize.Net Accept.js and the Authorize.Net payment API.

  

## Step 1. Initialize Cardinal Cruise.

  
## Step 2. Retrieve a Cardinal Cruise JWT from your server.

      
## Step 3.  Start the Consumer Authentication Flow.
  
  
## Step 4.  Receive the response from Cardinal Cruise  
  
  
## Step 5.  Call Accept.js to dispatch card data to Authorize.Net


## Step 6.  Complete the payment
